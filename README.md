We propose a <b>unified</b> graph representation for <b>zero-shot</b> goal-oriented navigation. Our method can be directly applied to different kinds of scenes and goals <b>without training</b>.


## News
- [2025/03/08]: Initial update. We are working for ICCV now. Arxiv and code will be released within two weeks.
- [2025/02/27]: UniGoal is accepted to CVPR 2025!
